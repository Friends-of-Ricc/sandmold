## Billing Investigation for `check-docs-in-go-slash-sredemo`

Upon inspection of the project's billing information, it has been determined that `billingEnabled` is set to `false`.

This indicates that the project is not currently linked to an active billing account, which is a common cause for `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors when attempting to use various Google Cloud services, including the SaaS Runtime.

**Available Billing Accounts:**

*   **SREDemo Onramp Trial Billing Account** (`billingAccounts/010405-23D342-257054`) - **NOT OPEN**
*   **SREDemo Billing Account** (`billingAccounts/016828-2CF7FA-17B3DD`) - **OPEN**
*   **TryGcp HighRep from Val to test b432463553** (`billingAccounts/018C68-C51FDE-8581DE`) - **OPEN**

**Next Steps:**
To resolve this, please ensure that a valid billing account is linked to the `check-docs-in-go-slash-sredemo` project and that billing is enabled. The previous attempt to link to `billingAccounts/016828-2CF7FA-17B3DD` failed because it is an internal Google billing account and cannot be linked to a non-Google project.

I now recommend linking it to `billingAccounts/018C68-C51FDE-8581DE`.

To do so, run the following command:
```bash
gcloud beta billing projects link check-docs-in-go-slash-sredemo --billing-account=018C68-C51FDE-8581DE
```
