# Sandmold Applications

This directory contains various applications that can be deployed using Sandmold.

## Applications

*   🤷 **foobar** (linked to [applications/foobar/blueprint.yaml](applications/foobar/blueprint.yaml)): A sample blueprint for the Google Cloud which basically does nothing, except logging a virtual application start and successful end. This is a sample application which does basically NOTHING except sleeping a configurable number of seconds to simulate the installation complexity and test eventual consistency. Eg, if you have an app which tells you how many apps have been correctly installed, it can be nice for a demo to set this to 5 minutes. Otherwise, you can set it to 0/1 seconds for a very fast installation. Note: this installation will FAIL every time you "activate the Omega 13" via AUTO_FAIL='omega13'. This way you can force this to fail on certain machines. Create: ✅ Destroy: ✅ Status: ✅
*   🛍️ **online-boutique** (linked to [applications/online-boutique/blueprint.yaml](applications/online-boutique/blueprint.yaml)): A sample blueprint for the Google Cloud Online Boutique microservices demo, inspired by K8s/KCC objects. Create: ✅ Destroy: ✅ Status: ✅
