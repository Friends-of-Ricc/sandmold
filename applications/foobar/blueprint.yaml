    A sample blueprint for the Google Cloud which basically does nothing, except logging a virtual application start
    and successful end.
    This is a sample application which does basically NOTHING except sleeping
    a configurable number of seconds to simulate the installation complexity and test
    eventual consistency. Eg, if you have an app which tells you how many apps have been correctly installed, it
    can be nice for a demo to set this to 5 minutes. Otherwise, you can set it to 0/1 seconds for
    a very fast installation.

    Note: this installation will FAIL every time you "activate the Omega 13" via AUTO_FAIL='omega13'. This way you can
    force this to fail on certain machines.
