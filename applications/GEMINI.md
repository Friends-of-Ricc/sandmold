Create a script which deterministically creates a `README.md` by prepending a reasonable `_README.before.md` and appending a ` _README.after.md` you will create for me.
. In the middle of the readme, a H2 Applications, and then it iterates through all the files in applications/*/ and does the following:

---- iterate thourgh this ---
* {{emoji}} **APP_NAME** (linked to the blueprint in APPNAME/blueprint.yaml)i if exists : {{description}} , then an emoji for Create, Destroy, Status scripts being presents. If something is not present, add a "Errors: XXX missing".
--- end ---
