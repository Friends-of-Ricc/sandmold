Travel Insurance
Last updated: June 17, 2025

The Google global travel assistance program is designed to keep you safe and healthy while you’re away from home on Google business or on international personal travel.

Google has contracted three leading companies to provide this benefit: International SOS (ISOS), Cigna International, and Chubb.

International SOS (ISOS): Single point of contact for all emergencies while traveling.
Cigna International: Provider of emergency medical benefits and emergency medical evacuation.
Chubb: Insurer against loss of personal property, loss and delay of luggage. 
For all travel and expense questions, visit go/travelandexpenses.

Google provides support for this policy.
Who can use this benefit
Full-time Alphabet employees are eligible for coverage during business and personal travel outside of their country of residence. Spouses/domestic partners and child dependents (up to age 26) are also covered if they’re accompanying the Googler on travel.

Apprentices and interns are eligible for coverage for business travel only under the Alphabet policy.

Temps, vendors, and contractors aren't eligible for the Alphabet policy, and should contact their employer directly to understand their benefits.

Policy & coverage
Travel Insurance covers Googlers while travelling outside of their normal country of permanent residence. These benefits cover emergency medical and urgent medical treatment while abroad, as well as emergency evacuation, loss of personal property, loss and delay of luggage, and AD&D benefits.

For full coverage details, review the Cigna policy and Chubb policy documents.

Important for non-U.S. Googlers traveling in the U.S.: If you receive medical care while traveling in the U.S. the Googler should not pay out of pocket for services. If you seek care, always give the provider our Cigna Global policy number (02335E) to have the provider bill Cigna directly. This is because in the U.S., providers are contracted directly with Cigna. Cigna is required to pay them directly and cannot reimburse the Googler.

If you have any questions on the travel insurance coverage and claims, call Cigna's Global MBA Customer Service team at +1 (800) 441-2668 (Toll-free US) or +1 (302) 797-3100 (Non-US) and reference our policy number: 02335E
Exclusions
Since the travel benefits are focused on the health and safety of Googlers, they do not cover all unexpected financial costs or losses associated with traveling.

What is NOT covered: Non-emergency travel costs incurred due to injury/illness (trip cancellations, trip interruptions, travel delays, additional accommodation, missed connections, flight upgrades, alternative return flights), non-urgent or pre-planned medical care, high risk sports (for example, skydiving), damaged items, rental car coverage, roadside assistance, personal liability, and legal costs are not covered.

Review the coverage in detail and consider if you require additional personal coverage for leisure travel.

For all exclusions, review the Cigna policy and Chubb policy.

Excluded countries:

The Chubb benefit doesn’t apply to an Insured Person traveling to Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Israel, Gaza, Lebanon, and West Bank.

Cigna cannot provide coverage for the following countries: Iran, Syria, Sudan, Ukraine, Cuba*, and North Korea.

Travel to any countries that are subject to US trade embargoes may also be excluded from certain benefits. If you’re traveling to such a country for personal reasons, we recommend you purchase personal travel cover. If you’re traveling for business, contact isos@google.com.

*If you’re a non-US citizen, ISOS and Chubb offer coverage in Cuba. Cigna is still not able to pay claims incurred in Cuba in connection with a holiday or vacation for US Googlers. However, with the recent changes to the Cuban sanctions, Cigna will now be able to reimburse non-US Googlers for medical services incurred in Cuba, as long as the payment is made outside of Cuba. Note that Cigna still cannot create coverage verification letters for travel to Cuba.
