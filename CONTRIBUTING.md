First off, thank you for considering contributing to Sandmold! It's people like you that make Sandmold such a great tool.

We welcome any type of contribution, not just code. You can help with:

*   **Reporting a bug**
*   **Discussing the current state of the code**
*   **Submitting a fix**
*   **Proposing new features**
*   **Becoming a maintainer**

## We Have a Code of Conduct

## Getting Started

*   **Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).
*   If you want to contribute but you're not sure where to start, take a look at the issues with the `good first issue` or `help wanted` labels.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please report it by opening an issue. To help us understand and fix the bug, please include as much detail as possible:

*   A clear and descriptive title.
*   A step-by-step description of how to reproduce the bug.
*   The expected behavior and what actually happened.
*   Your operating system, project version, and any other relevant information.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue to discuss it. This allows us to coordinate our efforts and prevent duplication of work.

*   **Small Changes** can be crafted and submitted to the GitHub Repository as a Pull Request.
*   **Major Changes** that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first in an issue.

### Pull Request Process

1.  **Fork the repo and create your branch from `main` (or `master`).**
2.  **Make your changes in a new git branch.**
3.  **If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.**
4.  **If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.**
5.  **Ensure the test suite passes.**
6.  **Make sure your code lints.**
7.  **Issue that pull request!**

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Before we can accept your patches, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

Contributions to any Google project must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This is not a copyright assignment, it simply gives Google permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project.

*   If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an individual CLA.
*   If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work, then you'll need to sign a corporate CLA.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one (even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it again.

You can find our CLA here: [https://cla.developers.google.com/](https://cla.developers.google.com/)

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

*   Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
*   Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
*   Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
*   Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### [Language Name] Styleguide
