Riccardo. After the Mac revolution on Monday afternoon, you need to remember:

1. restore the test BEFORE acting upon it.
2. Add some visualization. Given the folder_id, show:
   1. folder_id <=> folder name
   2. descendant folders and projects (bonus: recursively - but 1L is enough for debugging)
   3. Make it colorful.
3. Add folder tags.
4. Add "common" stanza (merges whatever is there to ALL projects)
