# Plan for Terraform Apply - Oct25

This plan outlines the steps to execute `terraform apply` for an existing classroom configuration and document the process.

## 1. Pre-flight Checks

- [x] Identify the target classroom YAML file to use for the deployment. I will use `etc/samples/classroom/2teachers_4realstudents.yaml`.
- [x] Define the workspace prefix as `oct25`.
- [x] Create a directory for logs and learnings at `doc/plans/oct25/`.

## 2. Execution

- [ ] Construct and execute the `bin/classroom-up.sh` command.
- [ ] Monitor the execution and capture the output.

## 3. Verification & Documentation

- [ ] Verify that the `terraform_output.json` is created in the correct workspace directory.
- [ ] Document any errors, learnings, or required fixes in `doc/plans/oct25/learnings.md`.
- [ ] Clean up created resources if necessary.
