# --- Regex Patterns for Validation ---

# Allows lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
# Must start with a letter, be between 6 and 30 chars, and not end with a hyphen.
# See: https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects#resource:-project
GCP_PROJECT_ID_REGEX = re.compile(r"^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{4,28}[a-z0-9]$")

# A relaxed regex for folder display names. Allows most characters, 3-30 length.
FOLDER_NAME_REGEX = re.compile(r"^.{3,30}$")

# A relaxed regex for workspace names (metadata.name).
# Allows letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores.
WORKSPACE_NAME_REGEX = re.compile(r"^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$")

# Allows uppercase letters, numbers, and underscores. Must start with a letter or underscore.
ENV_VAR_NAME_REGEX = re.compile(r"^[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*$")
