# Billing Account Impasse - 15-July-2025

## 1. The Goal

The primary goal was to successfully provision a sample classroom using the `just setup-sample-class` command, which orchestrates a `terraform apply`.

## 2. The Problem

The provisioning process repeatedly fails during the `terraform apply` phase when attempting to associate a billing account with newly created projects.

## 3. Troubleshooting Journey

We systematically attempted to resolve the issue by addressing a series of distinct errors:

1.  **Initial Quota Error:** The first attempts with the user `ricc@google.com` and billing account `01C588-4823BC-27F650` failed with a `Cloud billing quota exceeded` error.
2.  **Org Policy Constraint:** Switching to an internal Google billing account (`01EA9E-528725-FACCCF`) failed with a `constraints/billing.outsideGoogleBillingMdbWhitelist` violation. This was an organizational policy preventing an internal BA from being used on an external organization (`sredemo.dev`).
3.  **Switched Identity:** We switched the active user to `palladiusbonton@gmail.com` to access personal billing accounts with available coupons.
4.  **Found New Billing Account:** Using the `open-baids` command, we identified `0103D2-91481A-505127` as a promising candidate.
5.  **Granted IAM Permissions:** The `palladiusbonton@gmail.com` user was progressively granted the following roles to resolve permission errors:
    -   `roles/resourcemanager.folderAdmin` on the target folder.
    -   `roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator` on the target folder.
    -   `roles/billing.user` on the billing account `0103D2-91481A-505127`.
6.  **Final `PERMISSION_DENIED` Error:** Despite granting all the necessary roles (and verifying them with `gcloud ... get-iam-policy`), the `terraform apply` *still* fails with a `missing permission ... billing.resourceAssociations.create` error.

## 4. Conclusion: The Impasse

We have reached an impasse. The error message is inconsistent with the verified IAM permissions. This strongly suggests the issue is not with our code, scripts, or local permissions, but with a deeper, non-obvious policy or configuration constraint on the billing account `0103D2-91481A-505127` or its interaction with the `sredemo.dev` organization.

**The path forward requires manual intervention from Google Cloud Support or a Cloud Billing specialist.** The detailed error messages from the final Terraform run should be provided to them to diagnose the underlying issue.
