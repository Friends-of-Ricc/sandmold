* Help me write an article on Sandmold. Code in this git repo.

## highlights/Topics

This article needs to highlight: 

* lessons learnt, failures, and successes. Many failures, here!
* SaaS runtime GCP product and how I used it.
* need to be very visual, I need you to help me create those visuals.

## Your job

We're going to co-write the article.

Your job is:
1. Read the code and help me abstract the top features.
2. read the presentation from `DO_NOT_COMMIT/*pdf` and get ideas from there. 
  * DO NOT COMMIT that pdf as it has some private images and links.
  * Feel free however to steal images from there: plenty of beautiful images, like in slide 1, 3, 4, 33, 46!


## Article tips

In the article, keep this in mind.

* Rename Heapster Shop and Microservices DEmo as "online boutique" and link to their GH repo: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo
* Link "Bank of Anthos" to their repo: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bank-of-anthos
* try to be fun but terse, not verbose, not psychofantic, do not write useless "AI Slops" but be straight to the point.
