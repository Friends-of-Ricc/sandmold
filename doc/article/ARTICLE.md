This summer, I was given the time to do some profound learning on the Ops side, and I decided to bump up my Terraform skills while coding with Gemini CLI.

This article describes my journey. Not being a Terraform habitue', there were many lessons to be learnt ;) , and I hope this can help others build on top of it, and learn from my failures.
