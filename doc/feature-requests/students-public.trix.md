If at a workshop with N students, ensure we have an OUTPUT spreadsheet being created, which is student-centric.
So each line will have a  student email, and in other columns things like:

1. project id
2. link to project_id landing page.
3. Maybe a link to the app (which is project_id templated, like `cloud.google.com/jss/app123?project_id={{PROJECT_ID}}`)
