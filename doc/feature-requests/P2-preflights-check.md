# Check Billing, Folders and visualize nicely

Check @doc/quotas/image.png for projects, its well above 8. Please create a script which does some preflights checks on the YAML, eg  "bin/preflights-check.py". Lets start inspecting the BAID and the folder id. 1. Write Billing Id name, description, and what type is it (credit card, google   credits, invoice, ..). Then explore the folders in the config, and show the sub folders and sub projects for the folder_id for this. Create it and execute it. Make it colorful, emojiful, and the folder visualization make it `tree`-like.
