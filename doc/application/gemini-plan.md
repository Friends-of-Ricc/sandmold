# Gemini's Plan for Application Deployment

This document outlines the plan for implementing the application deployment functionality as described in issue #13.

## Phase 1: Planning and Scaffolding

1.  **Create a feature branch.** (Done)
2.  **Create this plan document.** (Done)
3.  **High-level plan discussion on GitHub.**
4.  **Detailed plan refinement.**

## Phase 2: Implementation

1.  **Develop a script to parse the classroom configuration YAML.** This script will extract the list of applications to be deployed for each project.
2.  **Implement prerequisite checks for each application:**
    *   Verify the existence of `start.sh`, `stop.sh`, and `status.sh` in the application's directory.
    *   Check for the presence of required environment variables.
3.  **Create a mechanism to generate Terraform variables (`.tfvars`) for each project.** This will include:
    *   Project-specific variables.
    *   Class-level variables.
    *   Automatically generated variables (`GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, `SANDMOLD_DESK_TYPE`).
4.  **Integrate with Terraform's `local-exec` provisioner** to execute the `start.sh` scripts for each application.
5.  **Develop a reporting mechanism** to capture the success or failure of each application deployment, including the `_APP_MALFORMED_` error.

## Phase 3: Testing and Refinement

1.  **Create a test classroom configuration YAML** that includes the `foobar` application and a project with `AUTO_FAIL`.
2.  **Perform a full end-to-end test** of the application deployment process.
3.  **Refine the implementation** based on test results.

## Phase 4: Documentation and Pull Request

1.  **Update `doc/TF_INTERFACES.md`** to reflect the new interface for application deployment.
2.  **Create a Pull Request** linked to issue #13, with a detailed description of the changes.
